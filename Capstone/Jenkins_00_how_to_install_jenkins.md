Certainly, I can help you with a bash script to bootstrap Jenkins installation on an Ubuntu server running on AWS. Here's a script that should accomplish this:



```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Java (Jenkins requires Java to run)
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

# Add Jenkins repository key
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

# Add Jenkins repository
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Jenkins
sudo apt install jenkins -y

# Start Jenkins service
sudo systemctl start jenkins

# Enable Jenkins to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

# Print initial admin password
echo "Initial Admin Password:"
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# Print Jenkins status
sudo systemctl status jenkins

# Print public IP address (assumes AWS EC2 instance)
echo "Your server's public IP address is:"
curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

echo "Jenkins installation complete. Access it via http://YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8080"

```

This script does the following:

1. Updates the system
2. Installs Java (required for Jenkins)
3. Adds the Jenkins repository
4. Installs Jenkins
5. Starts the Jenkins service and enables it to start on boot
6. Prints the initial admin password
7. Displays the Jenkins service status
8. Retrieves and displays the public IP of the EC2 instance

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `install_jenkins.sh`) on your local machine.
2. Upload it to your Ubuntu server on AWS.
3. Make the script executable with `chmod +x install_jenkins.sh`.
4. Run the script with `sudo ./install_jenkins.sh`.

After running the script, you should be able to access Jenkins by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP:8080`.

Remember to configure your AWS security group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080 so you can access the Jenkins web interface.

Would you like me to explain any part of this script in more detail?
