Certainly! I can help you set up a Jenkins pipeline that will automatically retrieve and apply changes to your hospital web application whenever modifications are made to your bootstrap script. Here's how we can achieve this:



```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        GITHUB_REPO = 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
        BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT = '18_Final_bootstrap.sh'
        APP_DIR = '/path/to/your/hospitalwebapp'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: "${GITHUB_REPO}"
            }
        }

        stage('Check for Changes') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def changes = sh(script: "git diff HEAD^ HEAD -- ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT}", returnStatus: true)
                    if (changes == 0) {
                        echo "Changes detected in ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT}"
                        env.SCRIPT_CHANGED = 'true'
                    } else {
                        echo "No changes in ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT}"
                        env.SCRIPT_CHANGED = 'false'
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Update Application') {
            when {
                expression { env.SCRIPT_CHANGED == 'true' }
            }
            steps {
                script {
                    // Copy the updated bootstrap script to the application directory
                    sh "cp ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT} ${APP_DIR}/"

                    // Run the bootstrap script
                    sh "cd ${APP_DIR} && sudo bash ${BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT}"
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Restart Services') {
            when {
                expression { env.SCRIPT_CHANGED == 'true' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'sudo systemctl restart hospital_queue'
                sh 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed. Please check the logs for details.'
        }
    }
}

```

To set up this automated process with Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Jenkins on your server if you haven't already.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job:
   - In Jenkins, click "New Item"
   - Enter a name for your job (e.g., "HospitalWebAppUpdate")
   - Choose "Pipeline" and click "OK"

3. In the job configuration:
   - Under "Pipeline", choose "Pipeline script" and paste the script from the artifact above.
   - Modify the environment variables at the top of the script:
     - Set `GITHUB_REPO` to your GitHub repository URL
     - Set `APP_DIR` to the directory where your hospital web app is located

4. Set up GitHub webhooks:
   - In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Add a new webhook
   - Set the Payload URL to `http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/`
   - Choose "application/json" as the content type
   - Select "Just the push event"
   - Save the webhook

5. In Jenkins, install the GitHub plugin if not already installed.

6. In your Jenkins job configuration, under "Build Triggers", check "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling".

7. Save the Jenkins job configuration.

This setup will:
- Monitor your GitHub repository for changes
- When changes are detected in the `18_Final_bootstrap.sh` file, it will:
  - Copy the updated script to your application directory
  - Run the bootstrap script to apply changes
  - Restart the necessary services

Remember to grant Jenkins the necessary permissions to run these commands, possibly using sudo. You may need to modify your sudoers file to allow Jenkins to run specific commands without a password.

Also, ensure that your Jenkins server has access to your GitHub repository and the necessary permissions to deploy to your application server.

This solution provides an automated way to keep your hospital web application up-to-date with any changes made to the bootstrap script. Whenever you push changes to the script in your GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically apply those changes to your production environment.
