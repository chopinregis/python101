To help you create this presentation:

1. Use this outline to create your PowerPoint slides. Each numbered item represents a new slide.

2. For each slide, create visually appealing content:
   - Use relevant images, icons, or diagrams to illustrate your points.
   - Keep text concise - use bullet points rather than long paragraphs.
   - Maintain a consistent color scheme and font throughout the presentation.

3. For the architecture and user journey slides, consider creating simple diagrams or flowcharts.

4. Include screenshots of your application for the user journey and admin dashboard slides.

5. For the demonstration slide, prepare a short live demo of your application, or create a brief video walkthrough.

6. Practice your presentation to ensure you can explain each slide clearly within your allotted time.

Here are some additional tips for your presentation:

1. Start with an engaging introduction that highlights the importance of efficient queue management in hospitals.

2. Use real-world statistics or examples to emphasize the problem you're solving.

3. When discussing the technology stack, briefly explain why each technology was chosen.

4. For the security measures slide, emphasize how using IAM roles improves the overall security of the system.

5. In the scalability section, mention how your AWS-based architecture allows for easy scaling as demand grows.

6. End with a strong conclusion that reiterates the main benefits of your system and its potential impact on healthcare delivery.
