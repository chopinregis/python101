"""
**Explanation:**

1. **Imports:** Import the `storage` library from `google.cloud`.
2. **Function Definition:** The function `create_bucket_and_upload` is triggered by an event (typically `http` for a web request).
3. **Bucket Name:** Replace `"your-unique-bucket-name"` with a desired globally unique bucket name.
4. **Storage Client:** Create a `storage.Client` object to interact with Cloud Storage.
5. **Bucket Existence Check:** Use `client.bucket(bucket_name).exists()` to check if the bucket already exists.
6. **Bucket Creation:** If the bucket doesn't exist, create it using `bucket.create()`.
7. **Temporary File:** Create a temporary file in `/tmp` with desired content.
8. **File Upload:** Use `blob.upload_from_filename` to upload the temporary file to the bucket with the name `data.txt`.

**Deployment:**

1.  Create a requirements.txt file with `google-cloud-storage` library.
2.  Deploy the function using the Google Cloud Console or `gcloud functions deploy` command.

**Note:**
- This example creates a temporary file in the Cloud Function's limited memory space. For larger files, consider alternative approaches like pre-creating the file and uploading it.
- Remember to set appropriate permissions for your Cloud Function to access Cloud Storage.

You can use this Cloud Function script in two main ways:

**1. Deployment via Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**

This is the recommended approach for using the Cloud Function in production. Here's how to deploy it:

**a. Create a Requirements File:**

1. Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your Cloud Function script (the Python file).
2. Add the following line to the `requirements.txt` file:
"""


# ```
# google-cloud-storage
# ```

# This specifies the library needed by the script.

# **b. Deploy the Function:**

# There are two main methods for deployment:

#  * **Using the Google Cloud Console:**
#      1. Go to the **Cloud Functions** section of the GCP Console ([https://cloud.google.com/functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)).
#      2. Click the **Create Function** button.
#      3. Choose a name for your function (e.g., "create_bucket_and_upload").
#      4. Select **Python** as the runtime and **HTTP** as the trigger type.
#      5. In the **Code** section, paste the Cloud Function script you created earlier.
#      6. In the **Dependencies** section, click **Select the location of your dependencies** and choose **Upload package**. 
#      7. Upload your `requirements.txt` file.
#      8. Click **Create**.

#  * **Using the `gcloud` Command-Line Tool:**
#      1. Make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured with your project.
#      2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Cloud Function script and `requirements.txt`.
#      3. Run the following command, replacing `<your-function-name>` with your desired function name:

#      ```bash
#      gcloud functions deploy <your-function-name> \
#          --runtime python39 \
#          --trigger-http \
#          --allow-unauthenticated \
#          --requirements requirements.txt
#      ```

# **2. Local Testing (Optional):**

# While not recommended for production use, you can test the Cloud Function locally using a Cloud Functions emulator. This helps verify functionality before deployment. Here's a general process:

# 1. Install the Cloud Functions emulator following the instructions in the official documentation ([https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/running/functions-emulator](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/running/functions-emulator)).
# 2. Start the emulator locally using the `gcloud functions emulators start local` command.
# 3. Modify your Cloud Function script to handle local execution (e.g., setting environment variables for authentication).
# 4. Run your Cloud Function script locally to test its behavior.

# **Remember:**

# - Replace `"your-unique-bucket-name"` in the script with your desired globally unique bucket name.
# - Make sure your Cloud Function has appropriate permissions to access Cloud Storage.
